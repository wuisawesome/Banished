He was their hero.

He was their hope.

When the shadows came				to steal their lives,
							he was their light.

But to them,					he was not.

They thanked him, 			but they were not thankful.
They praised him,			but they were not grateful.

And when it came time for him to falter,

	They exiled him.

They cursed him, they shunned him, they removed him from their homes.

They left him to wander the silent land

											alone.
											
											
		And thus,		he was
		
					Banished.
					
					

					
					
Such is the legend of the one who was banished.

No one knows anything else about him.

	Who he was
	Where he went
	What he did
	
But a young boy lost in a cave
						may be the first to discover.
